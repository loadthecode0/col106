1. implement resizing in chaining -     NO NEED AS SAID BY INSTRUCTOR
2. implement resizing in probing (see what is recommended first tho) - NO NEED
3. format code to look nicer.
4. marking deletion concept is important for lookups!!!
5. test out probing methods.
6. For getTopK, don't push all values! Push only those which are available[.] = 0 slots!!

!!need to debug getTopK in Probing  ---- done
7. change appropriate variables to long long in quadratic probing
8. put sort function in other file.
9. linked list in comp part.
10. change variable names in murmur hash adaptation.

-- check finder function in LinearProbing


-- declaring public constructor function in header file has been allowed.
-- keeping array larger than 100000 ensures definite availability of empty slots in array for new accounts.
