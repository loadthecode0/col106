1. implement resizing in chaining -     NO NEED AS SAID BY INSTRUCTOR
2. implement resizing in probing (see what is recommended first tho) - NO NEED
3. format code to look nicer. --done
4. marking deletion concept is important for lookups!!! --done
5. test out probing methods. --done
6. For getTopK, don't push all values! Push only those which are available[.] = 0 slots!! --done

!!need to debug getTopK in Probing  ---- done
7. change appropriate variables to long long in quadratic probing
8. put sort function in other file. --DON'T
9. linked list in comp part.
10. change variable names in murmur hash adaptation.

-- check finder function in LinearProbing


-- declaring public constructor function in header file has been allowed.
-- keeping array larger than 100000 ensures definite availability of empty slots in array for new accounts.
